## NPCs & Progression

### Shnarken (Snarky Shopkeeper Creature)

The Shnarken are a creature type that serve as shopkeepers and progression guides throughout the world.

**Two Types:**

1. **Hut Shnarken** (one per biome)
   - Lives in a small hut
   - Cannot be fought
   - Fixed spawn location per biome
   - Discovering one adds a permanent marker to your map

2. **Traveling Shnarken** (rare spawn)
   - Wanders the world
   - Can be fought (very difficult)
   - Drops a unique wand if defeated

**Core Mechanics:**
- [ ] Create Shnarken NPC scene (base creature)
- [ ] Create Shnarken hut structure
- [ ] Spawn one Hut Shnarken per biome (fixed location)
- [ ] Implement Traveling Shnarken rare spawn system
- [ ] Add permanent map marker when Hut Shnarken discovered
- [ ] Implement shop interface
- [ ] Implement gear detection system
- [ ] Add dialogue system
- [ ] Make Traveling Shnarken fightable (drops unique wand)

**Dialogue Ideas:**

Early game (no gear):
> *"Poor, poor peasant. Do you even have armor? You're a muddy nudist!"*

Progression taunts:
- Acknowledges progress begrudgingly
- Prods toward next crafting goal
- Mocks for not having the "next cool thing"

**Inspiration:** Like Hugin (the bird) from Valheim, but:
- A recurring NPC you return to
- Uses mockery as motivation
- Creates a relationship through humor

## Lore Notes

### Shnarken - A Species

Shnarken are a species - a family of shop owners. They are always snarky and make fun of the player.

**Traveling Shnarken:** A rare spawn. You can shop with him and fight him. Very hard to win, but you get a very cool wand if you beat him. Good for shopping early game.

**Hut Shnarken:** Every biome will get exactly one permanent Shnarken hut. The spawn area will have one. As you explore other biomes, you'll come upon additional Shnarken huts.

**Behavior:**
- When you have no gear, they make fun of you: *"Poor, poor peasant. Do you even have armor? You're a muddy nudist."*
- When you come back with more gear, they prod you forward with the next thing to find
- Like the bird from Valheim, but one you come back to that will make fun of you for not having the next cool thing to make
