Travlaer that is a rare spone, you can shop and fight him, very hard to win and you get a very cool wand if you beat him. Good for shoping early game.
spawn with a snarky shop. When you have no gear it makes fun of you, saying somehting like: Poor poor pesent. Do you even have arm your a muddie nudeset.
    When you come back with more gear it prods you forward with the next thing to find. Kinda like the burid from vahilim but one you come back to and that will make fun of you for not having the next cool thiing to make.
