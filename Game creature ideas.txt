-Wand, sword, axe, knife.
-Dandelions that puff up As a warning sign, and then explode when you're too close to them. Think creepers in Minecraft, but these will float lazily through the air. Easy to avoid if you're paying attention.

Little rock trolls And gahnomes

biome ideas
-Dandelions in meadow Like serene area. Maybe make the grass light purple instead of green and more of a bluish
-There should be a Dark forest full of glowing things. Think dark greens. And blacks.
-Poison toxic biome With green goo in Rivers. Poison pit
-Inside a crystal forest theres Caves full of gems and pretty stones.Um the lower you go, the better the gems. And the crystal forest has trees where you can get cool crystal leaves and what not. Crystal apples giving you special health benefits.
-Down below should be a hellscape Instead of the normal volcano deserty idea, go below and still have your lava.hellsuit
-A portal that leads you to A void biome that sends you to a fleshy nightmare. Of brains and other oddities. Nether equivalent.

Blood magic like a skelly spawner.
Shield magic.
Different staffs, two-handed weapons. Or maybe one staff that you can change its inner gem.
Instead of Edder or Magic, call it brain power.HP, health points, S P stamina points, B P brain Points.
Potions. Both magic and potions for healing.
